Best Performers: Bagging Classifier & Gradient Boosting Classifier

Key Insights

Bagging: Uses all features → captures more patterns → slightly higher accuracy.

Gradient Boosting: Corrects previous errors → reduces bias → better predictions.

Ensemble methods improve over single models in accuracy and robustness.
